# Screech Machine

# Game Description
Screech Machine is a 1v1 Competitive Dodge ball Game where the ball gets faster the more it bounces. Players take on the role of the robots Grip or Jet as they duke it out to determine who is the King of Dodge ball. The game is developed using the Unity Engine. All code samples are written in C#.

# Role on the Project
I worked as the sole engineer on this project, coordinating with my project partner on design, art direction, and audio feel. As the engineer, I designed and implemented a series of complex systems that governed different aspects of the game such as behavior of the ball, the controller for the player, the game loop manager, as well as the various UI menus and game settings. Additionally, I set up the animations for the characters, implemented two player controller support, and collaborated on setting up the games scenes.
