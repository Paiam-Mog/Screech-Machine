# Screech Machine

# Game Description
A collaboration with USC Games and Berklee College of Music, Screech Machine is a 1v1 Competitive Dodge ball Game where the ball gets faster the more it bounces. Players take on the role of the robots Grip or Jet as they duke it out to determine who is the King of Dodge ball. The game is developed using the Unity Engine. All code samples are written in C#.

# Role on the Project
I worked as the sole engineer on this project, coordinating with my project partner on design, art direction, and audio feel. As the engineer, I designed and implemented a series of complex systems that governed different aspects of the game such as behavior of the ball, the controller for the player, the game loop manager, as well as the various UI menus and game settings. Additionally, I set up the animations for the characters, implemented two player controller support, and collaborated on setting up the games scenes. 

# Implemented Systems and Features 
Some of the systems and features that I have worked on or implemented during my time include:
 * Audio Management System that allow for a variety of different types of aduio to play including one time sound effects, looping audio tracks, songs with an introductory segment and a looping block, and Sound groups that play randomly selected variations in a sound effect
 * Dodgeball controller that tracks whether or not it is caught and held, orbits around the player when caught and properly tilts it's orbit path in relation to the direction the player aims the ball
 * Dynamic Stage and Music Selection System that allows the player to select any the backdrop along with the audio track to play during the match. The System allows for us to add as many backdrops or audio tracks as needed without changing any code.
 * Menu Button Controller System that allows for sprites and gameobjects in the scene to mimic the behavior of a UI button as well as detect which player is hovering over the button at a time and which player clicks the button
 * Multiplayer Management System that tracks the order of players connected to the game and which side of the screen a player is associated with to properly assign and initialize the respective UI and character animator
